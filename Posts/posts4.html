            Today i want to write in english, and i will probabily continue to do it. <br>

            Nowadays the relationship market is completely <strong>dogshit</strong>, and many conservatives people find
            themselves in this dogshit even though they didn't create it. <br>
            of course there are some man and woman with right values and morals, but is completely unbalanced.
            However it's not dogshit only for them it's also <strong>dogshit for the people who create this kind of
                situation.</strong>
            Many people think that the only important thing in a relationship is <strong>pleasures</strong>, and they
            seek this kind of satisfaction in sex, i'm not saying that sex should be excluded froma a relationship, it's
            an important thing because you can also create life with it. <br>
            It is a fact that frequent sex releases dopamine (for more information, <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab"> watch Andrew Huberman's videos on dopamine).</a>. When we
            have sex, there is a spike in dopamine that exceeds our baseline level, followed by a temporary drop, which
            can fall below this threshold. (Dopamine motivates us to pursue goals.)
            If sex becomes excessive or compulsive, the reward system can become dysregulated, leading to reduced
            motivation for other activities or feelings of apathy. <br>
            and then what do we do? we get tired of having sex with the same partner, <strong>so we change
                them</strong>, and it's a
            vicious circle, which is why nowadays the body count of a person is more then 10 at a young age.
            but there is a bigger problem, and that is why the relationship market is dogshit.

            Now we have girls who think that the only thing that men are interested is sex, and man who think that girls
            are whores, and if we keep going to this path, more people will be attracted in this kind of market,
            in the short term this kind of people will be fine because they will get what they want (pleasures), but in
            the long term it will not especially for the
            people that create this kind of situation, Because women will hate men and men will hate women creating a
            vicious circle, and I think
            that one of the problems linked to the decline in births is precisely this: they seek short-term pleasures
            instead of building long relationships. <br>
            So, at the moment, the relationship market is not in a good position for conservative people, but I think
            they will win in the end. For those that seek short-term pleasures, the market is good, but in the long run
            they will lose. <br>
            <strong>
                And believe me, you might consider changing sides. Joining the short-term team is easy, but to get in
                the
                conservative team (so the long-tearm team) it is not, and if you were on the wrong side, you will be
                mark forever.
            </strong>

            This only explains the scientific side, because then I could talk about the <strong>moral</strong> and
            <strong>spiritual</strong> sides,
            because with this type of behaviour you destroy your mind, and one of the causes that is both spiritual and
            moral is pornography.
